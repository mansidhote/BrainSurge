# 🧠 BrainSurge

  Your companion in detecting early signs of dementia!

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for detecting early signs of dementia through a mobile app for doctors, along with a web-based dashboard for healthcare professionals to analyze patient data.

The app includes various cognitive games designed to assess patients' memory, problem-solving skills, and mental health. The data collected from the app is analyzed and presented in graphical representations to assist doctors in identifying early signs of dementia.

## 🌟 Features

### 📱 Mobile App for Doctors

 Cognitive Games: Multiple games to assess cognitive abilities, including memory, problem-solving, and confusion.

 Data Collection: Collects data such as time taken, accuracy, and memory performance during the games.

 Firebase Integration: Stores patient data in a Firebase database for real-time tracking.

### 💻 Website for Doctors

 Patient Profiles: Doctors can search and view detailed patient profiles.

 Data Analysis: Graphical representations of collected data to help analyze patients' cognitive performance.

 Early Dementia Detection: Provides insights into potential early signs of dementia based on the test results.

 Objectives

## The main objectives of BrainSurge are:

### 1) Early Detection of Dementia:
To provide a tool that helps healthcare professionals detect early signs of dementia through cognitive assessment games. This will facilitate timely intervention and better management of the condition.

### 2) Comprehensive Assessment:
To offer a variety of cognitive games that assess different aspects of a patient's mental health, including memory, problem-solving skills, and overall cognitive function.

### 3) Patient Data Collection and Tracking:
To securely collect and store patient data from cognitive assessments using Firebase, allowing real-time access and monitoring by healthcare providers.

### 4) Graphical Data Analysis:
To present the collected data in graphical representations (charts, graphs) on the doctor’s web dashboard. This helps healthcare professionals analyze cognitive performance and identify potential early signs of dementia.

### 5) User-Friendly Interface:
To design an easy-to-use interface for both healthcare providers and patients, ensuring accessibility and improving patient engagement.

## 🚀 Future Scope

### 1) Integration with Wearables:
Integrating the app with wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) to track daily activities, sleep patterns, and physical health, which could provide additional insights into cognitive health.

### 2) Advanced Machine Learning Models:
Implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze data more effectively and predict the likelihood of developing dementia based on patterns observed in the cognitive tests and daily activities.

### 3) Cross-Platform Support:
Expanding the mobile app to be compatible with both Android and iOS to reach a wider audience.

### 4) Enhanced Graphical Representations:
Adding more advanced visualizations such as heatmaps, trend graphs, and interactive reports to make the data easier to interpret for healthcare professionals.

### 5) Data Sharing with Hospitals:
Enabling the sharing of patient data with hospitals or research institutions for collaborative diagnosis and treatment.
